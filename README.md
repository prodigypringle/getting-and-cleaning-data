# getting-and-cleaning-data
This repository holds the R code and documentation files for the Data Science track course "Getting and Cleaning Data".

The following questions are answered:

R script called run_analysis.R is created that does the following: 

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# Files

CodeBook.md describes the how to use the variables, the data, and transformations performed to clean up the data.

File: run_analysis.R contains the code to perform the analysis described in the 5 steps.

The output of the 5th step is called TidySet.txt.
